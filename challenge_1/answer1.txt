What are conditionals and can you name two specific ones?

---------------------------------

Conditionals are used in Programming as directions for what you want
the program to run, when and under what premises.

ex.

If (boolean condition/True or false) Then
    (consequent/do this)
 Else
    (alternative/do this instead)
 End If
